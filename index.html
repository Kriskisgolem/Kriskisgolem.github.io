			<b><i>Humans are told to have been the dominant race on Nirva before the Second Conjunction, but the cataclysm decimated their numbers. Most of the conquering races that came inhabited the same climates as humans and halflings, preventing them from reforming any nation of their own. Since then, humans are a minority, living anywhere they can. Most races fear them and are glad for this fact, because humans are generally healthier and better at everything. They are naturally skillful and each of them possesses an inborn talent.
			<br>Humans are humanoids with round ears. They have unique skin tones, shared only by other Humanlike races. Humans are known for their varied looks.</i></b><br>

			<b><i>Goliaths had a small population even before the Second Conjunction. Even though their number diminished in the cataclysm, none of the conquering races were acclimate to altitudes as high as goliaths lived. This means they remained the only inhabitants of their snowy mountain peaks. Goliaths traditionally live in tribes and regularly climb down to demand tribute from nearby settlements and raiding them if they weren't given their due.
			<br>Goliaths are humanoids with round ears, with a tendency of being more muscular and vigorous. They have pale, greyish skin tones and like to wear tribal tattoos. Goliaths are on the smaller side of the Large size category.</i></b><br>

			<b><i>Not much is known about the Halflings' role in societies before the Second Conjunction, but the cataclysm left them on the brink of extinction as well. Most of the conquering races that came inhabited the same climates as humans and halflings, preventing them from reforming any nation of their own. Since then, halflings are a minority, living anywhere they can. They are usually disliked by societies, because their evolutionary talents make them adept burglars and pickpockets. Altough nature most likely made them so they can elude larger creatures, halflings can outstandingly utilize their feature in modern warfare.

			<summary>Description:</summary>
			<b><i>Dwarves were a numerous race on Nirva before the Second Conjunction, but the cataclysm decimated their numbers. Most of the conquering races that came were surface dwellers, allowing the dwarves to recover relatively well. Their main rivals are the goblins, who know populate a large portion of old dwarven territories. Dwarves are a proud and hardy race who make their home in mountains, where they mostly build underground. Their Stone Sense, darkvision and resilience helps them navigate the caves, while their Ironblood gives them an innate talent in craftsmanship. Dwarven kingdoms are famous for their mining, masonry and forging expertise.
			<br>Dwarves are humanoids with round ears. They have unique skin tones, shared only by other Humanlike races. Dwarves are short and have small legs compared to the rest of their body. They mostly possess stocky builds with large arms. Their hands are generally larger and outsize the hands of other medium humanoids most of the time, altough this is hardly ever true for dwarf females. Male Dwarves made a strong tradition out of growing beards.</i></b><br>

		<br><strong>Small Legs: </strong>Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
		<br><strong>Darkvision: </strong>Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
		<br><strong>Great Vitality: </strong>Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.
		<br><strong>Dwarven Resilience: </strong>You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.

		<br><strong>Ironblood: </strong>You gain proficiency with one of the following tools: Mason's Tools, Jeweler's Tools, Smith's Tools. This proficiency doesn't count against your tool limit.
		<br><strong>Stone Sense: </strong>Granted by your racial magic you can easily read informations from stone surfaces, and always know which way is North. The readable informations are the stone's type, it's "depth" (you'll know if there's space behind it in close proximity) and any marks left by creatures (even ones that cannot be seen with normal vision).

		<summary class="parent">Duergar</summary>
		<details>
			<summary>Description:</summary>
			<b><i>People belive that during the old times, dwarves went to live so deep under the earth, that they became Kranic. What we know for sure is that Duergar lived in the Underdark Tunnels, even before the Second Conjunction. They too felt the effects of the cataclysm, which made them unable to stop the elves from making a foothold in their homeland. Even from a disadvantageous position, they managed to retreat and replenish enough to take up fight against the invaders, who later became known as Drows. Because ark doesn't reach the Underdark, Kranic creatures developed and lived without it. While they cannot use magic, they're immune to magic itself. Like all Kranics who come to the surface, Duergars are treated with fear and disgust, which pushes them towards crime. We know that Duergar society is godless, feudal, patriarchal and that they're still waging guerilla warfare against the Drow but little else.
			<br>Duergars are humanoids with round ears. They have white skin, which changes to blue/purple once they approach the surface. Altough they are always born with white hair and red iris, this can also change along with their skin color in rare cases. Duergars are short and have small legs compared to the rest of their body. They mostly possess stocky builds with large arms. Their hands are generally larger and outsize the hands of other medium humanoids most of the time, altough this is hardly ever true for Duergar females. Male Duergars made a strong tradition out of growing beards.</i></b><br>

		<br><strong>Ability Score Increase: </strong>Gain +2 to one score and +1 to another or +1 to three scores.
		<br><strong>Age: </strong>You reach adulthood at the age of 18, but you don't grow old, which means your body stays in its prime. If you ever leave the Underdark, your body will deteriorate at the cellular level and begin aging. You start growing old after 50 years, you are very old starting from 70 years and can live up to around 100 years.
		<br><strong>Size: </strong>Your size is medium (Height range 140cm-160cm).
		<br><strong>Small Legs: </strong>Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
		<br><strong>Dwarven Resilience: </strong>You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.
		<br><strong>Superior Darkvision: </strong>Accustomed to the Underdark Tunnels, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
		<br><strong>Sunlight Hypersensitivity: </strong>While standing in sunlight, you have disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls and saving throws and receive vulnerability to all damage. Clothes cannot protect you from this, only the shadows cast by especially solid structures. You can only see out to a range of 120ft through sunlight.
		<br><strong>Spellcasting Inability: </strong>You can't cast spells. You can only attune to a very limited amount of magic items. Your body is compatible with chrome, but you aren't able to use chrome prosthetics (meaning that you can effectively replace missing bones with chrome, but you won't be able to move or see through a chrome eye that you placed in).
											<br>Works (doesn't affect body, doesn't cast magic): Gloves of Thievery, Boots of Elvenkind, Armor of Resistance, Bracers of Defence, *damaging weapons*
											<br>Doesn't work: Stone of Good Luck, Cloak of Protection, Eyes of Eagle, ...almost every magic item
		<br><strong>Magic Immunity: </strong>Your body is immune to all magical effects and damage and can't be targeted by magical effects. (Both hostile and friendly, like Cure Wounds. You can't see through magical darkness, but you can move through magical barriers, altough none of your items or clothes can.
											<br>Conjuration spells like Entangle can't target you with their effect, but it's area is still difficult terrain for you and the fog summoned by Fog Cloud limits your vision normally, while Hunger of Hadar has no effect on you.
											<br>Illusion spells like Disguise Self and Invisibility project a general image, which means you see them like others do. But other illusion spells like Phantasmal Force still can't target you or hurt you in any way.)
											<br>You cannot be teleported in any way, which means you're forever bound to Nirva.
		<br><strong>Languages: </strong>Common and Durgish (generally, but you can choose others based on your origin).

											<br>Conjuration spells like Entangle can't target you with their effect, but it's area is still difficult terrain for you and the fog summoned by Fog Cloud limits your vision normally, while Hunger of Hadar has no effect on you.
											<br>Illusion spells like Disguise Self and Invisibility project a general image, which means you see them like others do. But other illusion spells like Phantasmal Force still can't target you or hurt you in any way.)
											<br>You cannot be teleported in any way, which means you're forever bound to Nirva.
		<br><strong>Languages: </strong>Common and Drow (generally, but you can choose others based on your origin).

			<b><i>Rock Gnomes are descendants of the Eladrin Gnomes, who came from Feyvi during the Second Conjunction. The Eladrin formed four large groups who settled differently on their new home, Nirva. Due to the significant differences in the atmospheres, the Eladrin changed after their migration. (Fey creatures are volatile and cannot preserve their original nature outside Feyvi.) Originally, all gnomes came as slaves to the elves. Those dragged into the mainland settlements became Rock Gnomes. Altough most of them became free during the course of histroy, their racial features developed solely under slavery. Their magic, combined with their inborn talent, makes them an optimal workforce. Their ability in identifying spells and magic items set them on their path to become the most renowned artificers, but it's also what inspired the High Elves to create a spell with the same effect.
			<br>Rock Gnomes are short, pointy-eared humanoids, with skin tones similiar to "white Humans". Altough Halflings are a bit taller, have a wider range of skin tones and are generally more muscular, Rock Gnomes are commonly confused with them if their ear isn't showing.</i></b><br>

Due to the significant differences in the atmospheres, the Eladrin changed after their migration. (Fey creatures are volatile and cannot preserve their original nature outside Feyvi.) Originally, all gnomes came as slaves to the elves. The ones dragged down into the Underdark became Kranic creatures and gained the name "Deep Gnomes". Because ark doesn't reach the Underdark, Kranic creatures developed and lived without it. While they cannot use magic, they're immune to magic itself. Like all Kranics who come to the surface, Deep Gnomes are treated with fear and disgust, which pushes them towards crime. We know that Deep Gnomes are still enslaved by the Drow in the Underdark, but little else.
			<br>Deep Gnomes are short, pointy-eared humanoids with white skin, which changes to blue/purple once they approach the surface. Altough they are always born with white hair and red iris, this can also change along with their skin color in rare cases.</i></b><br>
		</details>
        <p>
		<strong>Creature Type(s): </strong>Humanoid, Kranic
		<br><strong>Ability Score Increase: </strong>Gain +2 to one score and +1 to another or +1 to three scores.
		<br><strong>Age: </strong>You reach adulthood at the age of 20, but you don't grow old, which means your body stays in its prime. If you ever leave the Underdark, your body will deteriorate at the cellular level and begin aging. You start growing old after 85 years, you are very old starting from 115 years and can live up to around 165 years.

		<br><strong>Superior Darkvision: </strong>Accustomed to the Underdark Tunnels, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
		<br><strong>Sunlight Hypersensitivity: </strong>While standing in sunlight, you have disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls and saving throws and receive vulnerability to all damage. Clothes cannot protect you from this, only the shadows cast by especially solid structures. You can only see out to a range of 120ft through sunlight.
		<br><strong>Spellcasting Inability: </strong>You can't cast spells. You can only attune to a very limited amount of magic items. Your body is compatible with chrome, but you aren't able to use chrome prosthetics (meaning that you can effectively replace missing bones with chrome, but you won't be able to move or see through a chrome eye that you placed in).

			<summary>Description:</summary>
			<b><i>Orcs came from Akra during the Second Conjunction, along with other Goblinoids. They are distinct from other humanoid Goblinoids, for they were always at war with them. Because natural phenomena are especially hostile on Akra, the Goblinoids evolved a natural resistance against magic. Apart from this, Orcs are born survivors and one of the most endurant species on Nirva. Their famous bloodrage makes them less desirable as a race. Most commoners fear that their Orc neighbour will hurt themselves and start a rampage, even if the said Orc doesn't have any combat training.
			<br></i>Orcs are slightly pointy-eared humanoids with green/grey skin tones. They possess one or two pairs of tusks that doesn't fit in their mouth, but gives them an especially strong bite. They are a tall and generally strong species.</b><br>
		</details>
        <p>
		<strong>Creature Type(s): </strong>Humanoid, Goblinoid, Humanborn
		<br><strong>Ability Score Increase: </strong>Gain +2 to one score and +1 to another or +1 to three scores.
		<br><strong>Age: </strong>You reach adulthood at the age of 14, you start growing old at the age of 100, you are very old starting from the age of 120 and can live up to around 150 years.
		<br><strong>Size: </strong>Your size is medium (Height range 170cm-210cm).
		<br><strong>Lesser Magic Resistance: </strong>You have a +1 bonus on saving throws that you make against magical effects.
													<br>This feature counts as an advantage. Disadvantage negates it without doing any other harm and it always negates this before regular advantages first. If you would have this and regular advantage on your roll, you can only use one of them.
		<br><strong>Disease Resistance: </strong>You have advantage on saving throws against diseases.
		<br><strong>Great Vitality: </strong>Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.
		<br><strong>Bite: </strong>You can bite enemies as an attack. It counts as a natural weapon you're proficient with. You gain disadvantage on your attack if your target isn't Paralyzed/Unconscious, unless you're in grappling contact with them which grants you advantage on your attack roll. Your bite deals 1d6 + Strength modifier piercing damage.
		<br><strong>Bloodrage: </strong>When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead and begin a Bloodrage. Bloodrage ends upon recieving heal, getting reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 minute. While the Bloodrage persists, you receive disadvantage on Intelligence/Wisdom ability checks and saving throws and are incapable of competent speech. You also gain advantage on attack rolls, attack rolls are made against you at disadvantage and you may move an extra 30ft on your turns (unaffected by Dash).
										<br>You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Whenever this ability expires, you cannot use it again for 1 minute.
		<br><strong>Tenacious Body: </strong>Your exhaustion penalty equals half your level of exhaustion, rounded down. On your first day without proper eating, you won't receive exhaustion for it, but you must eat two rations the next day to avoid double exhaustion gain.
		<br><strong>Languages: </strong>Common and Orcish (generally, but you can choose others based on your origin).

			<b><i>Hobgoblins came from Akra during the Second Conjunction, along with other Goblinoids. They closely resemble other humanoid Goblinoids, for they were united with them against the Orcs. Because natural phenomena are especially hostile on Akra, the Goblinoids evolved a natural resistance against magic. Hobgoblins are famous for their ability to magically bond with allies to boost their prowess. They too can gain benefits from this connection, which means a lonely Hobgoblin is significantly weaker. Hobgoblins evolved to be leaders in goblin societies.

		<br><strong>Bite: </strong>You can bite enemies as an attack. It counts as a natural weapon you're proficient with. You gain disadvantage on your attack if your target isn't Paralyzed/Unconscious, unless you're in grappling contact with them which grants you advantage on your attack roll. Your bite deals 1d6 + Strength modifier piercing damage.
		<br><strong>Magical Kinship: </strong>You can perform an hour long ritual (that counts as a light activity during short and long rests) and choose targets up to your proficiency bonus, that you've seen within 30ft of you for the whole duration. The targets must have the Humanoid or the Goblinoid tag. The bond lasts up to 48 hours, but breaks early if you're no longer on the same plane of existence with someone, you end it on purpose as a minute long ritual, or you cast the bonding ritual again.
		<br><strong>Warlord's Wisdom: </strong>As a reaction, you can gain a proficiency from a bonded ally within 30ft of you that lasts until the start of your next turn. This can only be used for saving throws or skills that you're not proficient with. Your proficiency bonus counts, but it cannot be doubled, even if the ally has expertise.
		<br><strong>Empowering Aura: </strong>As a bonus action, you can choose one effect and extend an aura centered on youself with it. The aura has a radius of 30ft and lasts until you use it again or become Incapacitated. Only bonded allies in the aura gain the bonuses (you don't).
												<br>1) Relentless Assault: +1 to Spell Save DC and all Attack Rolls.
												<br>2) Stalwart Defense: +1 to AC and all Saving Throws.
												<br>3) Unbound March (starting from <u>level five</u>): gain the effects of a <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:freedom-of-movement" target="_blank">Freedom of Movement</a>.
												<br>(The target's movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained. The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target's movement or attacks.)
		<br><strong>Unity: </strong>As an action, you can set your bonded allies' places in the initiative order for the next turn. The bonded allies must be within 30ft of you. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
		<br><strong>Languages: </strong>Common and Goblin (generally, but you can choose others based on your origin).

		<br><strong>Blazing Core: </strong>You have fire charges that you can use in the following ways:
									<br>1) As a reaction you gain immunity to fire damage until the start of your next turn.
									<br>2) As a bonus action you deal 'prof.bonus'd6 fire damage to a creature you're in grappling contact with. They roll a Constitution saving throw and on a fail they suffer a disadvantage on grapple checks against you until the start of your next turn. The resistance grants them advantage on their save, while fire vulnerability/immunity makes it an auto fail/success for them.
									<br>3) As an action you burst out in flames. Each creature within 5ft of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to halve the damage, which is 'prof.bonus'd8 fire damage. You ignite all flammable objects in the area.
									<br>You have a number of these fire charges equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
		<br><strong>Core Eruption: </strong>As an action, you can overcharge your core and burst out into a flaming form. You can also do this while Incapacitated, cleansing the condition from yourself. Upon activation, each creature within 5ft of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to halve the damage, which is 'prof.bonus'd8 fire damage. You ignite all flammable objects in the area. While your form is active, you gain the following benefits:
									<br>1) You gain immunity to fire damage and the Incapacitated condition.
									<br>2) You gain an extra 15ft movement speed.
									<br>3) You are burning with great heat. If you start your turn with this effect active, you take 1d4 damage. If the ground directly below you is flammable it catches fire. Whenever a creature enters within 5ft of you or start their turn there it takes 1d4 fire damage, a creature you're in grappling contact with takes 3d4 fire damage.
									<br>4) If you take frost damage equal to your level, the 3) ability is disrupted for one round. (you gain it back at the start of the turn when you took the damage last round)
									<br>This effect lasts for one minute, but ends early if you're reduced to 0 Hit Points. (you cannot end it willingly) Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

			<b><i>While the four elements are at a constant war on Prodrom, some Genasi are able to flee to Nirva. While they cannot reproduce outside Prodrom, they have a state that constantly tries to smuggle peaceable Genasi off-world. Water Genasi are indomitable like the seas themselves. Their watery magic lets them conquer oceans as well as lands, bringing the might of the tides with them.
			<br>Water Genasi have a human-like body, that has a blank lower face (no nose and mouth). They have slightly pointy ears. Their skin has a similiar texture to a water elemental, while their hair looks like it's made of seaweed(opaque) or water(slightly-highly transparent).</i></b><br>
		</details>
        <p>
		<strong>Creature Type(s): </strong>Humanoid, Elemental
		<br><strong>Ability Score Increase: </strong>Gain +1 to two scores.
		<br><strong>Age: </strong>You don't age, but your planet will simply stop sustaining you at some point. On your 31st birthday, there is a 1% chance that your planet stops sustaining you making that day your last. On each of your birthdays, the chance goes up by 1%, meaning that you cannot live past 130. ("aging" is bound to your body and once you've become marked for death, no planet will sustain you)
		<br><strong>Size: </strong>Your size is medium (Height range 160cm-190cm).
		<br><strong>Hydrospeed: </strong>You have a swimming speed equal to your movement speed. This speed is doubled while you're fully submerged. You also gain 120ft blindsight through water.
		<br><strong>Elemental Nature: </strong>As a Genasi, you have the following traits:
											<br>-You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.
											<br>-You have no mouth but were born with a voice. You can magically speak any language you know with that voice.
											<br>-Can't eat, drink or breathe (you can't smell/taste). As an elemental force the planet sustains you with ark (only if it contains your element).
		<br><strong>Elemental Hide: </strong>You have resistance to Acid damage.
		<br><strong>Water Magic: </strong>You learn the <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:shape-water" target="_blank">Shape Water</a> cantrip.
		<br><strong>Wave Ward: </strong>As a reaction, you conjure up a flowing water shield around you that lasts until the end of your next turn. It has the following properties:
									<br>1) Whenever you'd take physical, acid, fire, frost or thunder damage from an attack or area effect, you negate 'prof.bonus'd4 damage from it. (you slow down physical effects and absorb fire/frost/thunder damage)
									<br>2) If your ward takes frost damage equal to your level, it freezes and falls down, ending its effects. The ward takes all frost damage it negates. Alternatively, a creature can directly target and damage only the ward, if their attack/spell lets them. (AC = 5, it fails all saving throws)
									<br>3) In order to Shove/Grapple you, a creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, otherwise their attempt is wasted. This only works against Large or smaller creatures.
									<br>You can use this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
		<br><strong>Liquid Escape: </strong>As an action, you can take on a liquid form to escape any restraint that holds you, while staying in place. (f.e.: manacle, grapple, etc.) You can only use this ability once every third turn.
		<br><strong>Tidal Resurgence: </strong>Unless you're incapacitated, you can stand up immediately after you gain the prone condition using your watery magic. You can only do this once, and regain the use of it at the start of your next turn.
